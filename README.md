# whitetail_speedrun_mod
Speedrunning mod for The Whitetail Incident.

# Installation
1. Go to "The Whitetail Incident/The Whitetail Incident_Data/Managed"
2. Replace "Assembly-CSharp.dll" with the mod. It's recommended you back up the file first.
3. Run/restart the game.

That should be it. On loading into the game, you begin with 100 stored ammo. Also, text should automatically skip through (no mashing required).
